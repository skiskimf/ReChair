# ReChair
Open-Source Customizable Chair Adaptations

Overview

This project started from a simple frustration: I love my chair, but it just doesn't do everything I need it to.  Height limitations, inability to lock in adjustable settings, mount height, were all found to detract from the full build and ability of my new chair. Rather than replacing it entirely, I wanted to adapt and improve it by modifying key components. This led to the idea of an open-source repository where anyone can contribute, modify, and 3D-print parts to enhance their existing chairs.  Ideally, users can model, scan, and create to their hearts content, to fabricate the best possible office or gaming chair!

Purpose

ChairMod is designed to be a community-driven project for customizing and upgrading chairs by adapting parts from major retailers and creating new solutions. The goal is to make chairs more comfortable, modular, and functional without needing to buy an entirely new one.

Features & Goals

Adaptable Armrests – Swap or modify armrests from other chairs.

Universal Base & Footrests – Create compatible bases or extend footrests.

Magnetic Pillow Support – Easily attach and adjust pillows for better ergonomics.

Adjustable Back Support & Headrests – Improve lumbar and neck support for different seating positions.

Sizeable Frames – Modify chair frames to fit different body types or preferences.

3D-Printed Parts – Open-source STL files for customizing chair components.

Contributing

This is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome! Whether you're modifying existing chair designs, sharing STL files for 3D printing, or improving adjustability, your input helps make seating more customizable for everyone.
